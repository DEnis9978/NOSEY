This is my first game that I have developed using the most recent version of Unreal Engine to date, Unreal Engine 5.5.3.

This is a YouTube link to the tutorial if you are interested to check it out yourself: https://youtu.be/e_SPuvO_l1w

I have learned valuable lessons following this tutorial, including:

- Assets: imported assets, textures, and applying textures to characters using material menu, activated Nanite for all assets. Create a new material for coin, make it shiny and rotate to feel make it more engaging and interesting.
- Animation: set up animations for walking, jumping, and idle using Blend Space 1D. Using blueprint variables to set velocity, speed and logic of the character.
- AI enemy: used blueprints, animations, and variables to create enemies that detect player movements and follow the player to attack it with an axe using AI elements.
- Audio: created a 3D audio system for both player and enemy footsteps, SFX for enemy attacks with axe, coin audio system.
- World design: designed the world using premade assets from Unreal Engine Fab to make to world more dynamic, interesting, and enjoyable. Used animated trees grass using Foliage tool to have optimized design.
- UI: design a UI system to show how many coins you have collected using blueprints, set font size, color, outline, and shadow to make it more visible.
